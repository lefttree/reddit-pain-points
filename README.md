## Why This Tool?

Finding product ideas shouldn't be guesswork. Every day, thousands of people describe their frustrations on Reddit — "I wish there was...", "Why isn't there a tool for...", "I'd pay for something that...". These are **validated pain points** from real users.

This tool **automates the discovery process**:
- Scrapes targeted subreddits for posts expressing frustration or unmet needs
- Uses AI to extract structured insights (pain point, audience, market size, solutions)
- Ranks opportunities by a composite score so you can focus on the best ones
- Presents everything in a clean, filterable dashboard

**Stop building products nobody wants. Start with real pain.**

## How It Works

1. **Scrapes** posts and comments from 12+ target subreddits (r/SaaS, r/startups, r/Entrepreneur, etc.)
2. **Filters** for pain-point language ("I wish", "frustrated", "need a tool", etc.)
3. **Analyzes** each match with Google Gemini to extract structured insights
4. **Ranks** opportunities by a composite score (engagement × severity × market potential)
5. **Displays** everything in a clean, filterable dashboard

#### 3. Run the Scraper

```bash
cd backend

# Scrape Reddit + analyze with AI (full pipeline)
python cli.py run

# Or run steps separately:
python cli.py scrape                    # Just scrape
python cli.py analyze                   # Just analyze unanalyzed posts

python cli.py stats                     # View database stats
```

#### 4. Start the Dashboard

```bash
# Option A: Quick start (both services)
./run.sh

# Option B: Manual
cd backend && python cli.py serve &    # API on :8000
cd frontend && npm run dev &           # UI on :5173
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** to browse discovered pain points.

## Example Output

Here's what an analyzed pain point looks like:

```
🎯 Pain Point: "No simple tool to aggregate feature requests from multiple
   channels (email, Slack, support, social) for small teams"

📊 Opportunity Score: 82/100
